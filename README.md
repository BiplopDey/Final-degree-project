# Abstract

The main objective of this project is to contribute to the development of the Q-ARY CODES library within MAGMA system to efficiently work with nonlinear q-ary codes.
Specifically, we have developed the functions DirectSum(C, D), DirectSum(Q), PloktinSum(C, D),  and PadCode(C, n) that construct q-aris codes. 
The main goal is divided into four parts. The first part has consisted of studying the theory of q-ary codes over finite fields with q elements. 
For linear codes, coding and decoding has been studied, and for nonlinear codes results that allow to implement the mentioned functions more efficiently have been proved. 
The second part has consisted of learning the MAGMA system and its library for linear codes, as well as the Q-ARY CODES library. 
In the third part the functions by using different algorithms have been implemented, according to the theory of the first part. 
Finally, the functions have been validated and performance studies have been performed to determine which algorithm for each function is the best, using the q-ary codes library.

## About the project

The project consited of adding new funtion to the Univeristy's Q-ARY CODES library for the Department of Computer Science, under the supervision of Phd Mercè Villanueva.

## Test

Black box unit test and performance test of the functions:
- DirectSum
- DirectSumQ
- PadCode
- PlotkinSum

## Stack
- [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) is a large, well-supported software package designed for computations in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics.
- [LaTeX] is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.
- Visual Studio Code for editing.
- University's remote server to run the tests.
